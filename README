groblad - record botanical observations

groblad makes it convenient to record botanical observations into a
text file for future reference.

Observations are grouped as a list of the species seen at a specific
place and time. The format and fields are based on the paper field
lists used during the census which ended up as Västergötlands
Flora. See groblad(5).

The basic idea is to fill in a template (using a text editor of your
choice, which groblad starts for you). When you exit the editor, the
observations are trimmed, syntax-checked, and appended to file.

groblad is related and similar to Gavia[0], a tool for recording bird
sightings.  There is also some explicit support for exporting data to
Artportalen[1].


REQUIREMENTS

To compile and install groblad, you'll need a C++11 compiler and Perl.
To compile the unit tests, you need orchis[2].
To use the internal Dyntaxa manipulation scripts, you need Python 2.x
and the python-xlrd package.

Using groblad works best if you combine it with GNU Emacs and a
revision control system, like Git.
