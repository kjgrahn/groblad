.SH "NAME"
groblad \- record botanical observations
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B groblad
.RB [ \-f
.IR template ]
.RB [ \-s
.IR species ]
.I file
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B groblad
makes it convenient to record 
botanical observations into a text file
for future reference.
.P
Observations are grouped as a list of the species seen at a specific place and time.
The format and fields are based on
the paper field lists used during the census which ended up as
.IR "V\(:asterg\(:otlands Flora" .
See
.BR groblad (5).
.PP
The basic idea is to fill in a template (using a text editor of your choice, which
.IR groblad
starts for you).
When you exit the editor, the observations are trimmed, syntax-checked,
and appended to
.IR file .
.
.SS "Text encoding"
.B groblad
supports
.B Latin-1
and
.BR UTF-8 -encoded
text, independently of your
.BR locale (5)
settings.
Editors typically save a text file using the encoding it had when opened.
Provided yours does,
and your observations file,
template file and list of supported taxa all use a specific encoding,
the added observations will use that encoding, too, and all is well.
.
.SS "Emacs-specific features"
If the editor is
.BR emacs ,
the original file is opened in a second buffer in the background, so that
.I "M-x dabbrev-expand"
can fetch words (like place names) from earlier entries and make input
easier and less prone to spelling errors.
.LP
Also,
.B gavia
comes with an Emacs mode for viewing and editing excursions, called
.BR gavia-mode .
This mode works for
.B groblad
files, too.
It colorizes, and lets you mark a species as seen by pressing
.IR F4 .
To use it, install gavia and put this line in your Emacs startup file (typically
.IR ~/.emacs ):
.IP
.nf
.ft CW
(require 'gavia-mode)
.fi
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.BP \-f\ \fItemplate
Use
.I template
instead of
.I ~/.flora
or
.IR INSTALLBASE/lib/groblad/default .
.
.BP \-s\ \fIspecies
Use
.I species
as the list of recognized species and other taxa, instead of
.IR INSTALLBASE/lib/groblad/species .
.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I ~/.flora
Personal excursion template file. May contain only a subset of
all species. Fields, e.g.
.IR observers ,
may be pre-filled.
.TP
.I INSTALLBASE/lib/gavia/default
Global excursion template file, used if the personal template isn't
available
and none has been given using the
.B \-f
flag.
.TP
.I INSTALLBASE/lib/groblad/species
The default list of supported taxa and their taxonomic ordering; see
.BR groblad_species (5).
Used by
.B groblad
only to issue warnings about misspelled species names;
you may in fact use any name you choose.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP GAVIAEDITOR
Specifies the editor to use.
If not set,
.I VISUAL
or
.I EDITOR
is used instead.
If none of these are set, the default is
.BR emacs (1).
