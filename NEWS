Major changes to groblad by version, latest first:

groblad 1.10 (2010-04-05):

 - The species list: redid the parsing of Karlsson (2004) fixing many
   errors, especially in the Latin names. Some new names were added
   and others disappeared ... although nothing you're likely to see.

 - Checked if (Karlsson 2004) has been updated since 2004.
   It hasn't.

groblad 1.9 (2010-04-01):

 - groblad_report --fv, a variation of --svalan for people who are Floraväktare
   and still want to report as usual.

groblad 1.8 (2010-03-22):

 - new utility groblad_grep(1) - grep botanical observations.

groblad 1.7 (2010-03-19):

 - the species list: include a few commonly used synonyms
   (e.g. "tussilago" for "hästhov", and some where Västergötlands
   Flora deviates from Karlsson 1997).
 - groblad_report: include observers in the --svalan report, and
   exclude yourself with the --me option.

groblad 1.6 (2009-08-16):

 - accept 'Status' as an additional excursion field, for e.g.
   'I have reported this' or whatever
 - groblad_report: changes to simplify import to Svalan (--svalan):
   - when the RT90 coordinate claims 1m resolution, say 5m instead
   - do not sort the list in taxonomical order, keep places together

groblad 1.5 (2008-10-13):

 - groblad_report --sundh/svalan: fill in the RT90 coordinate
   accuracy. Groblad uses the standard RT90 notation for accuracy --
   dropping digits to the right. This now gets translated; 64445 13717
   ends up as 6444500 1371700 100. (Or should that be 6444550 1371750
   100? Never mind.)

groblad 1.4 (2007-12-02):

 - groblad_report: improved syntax checking (earlier versions were
   quite sloppy and silently accepted many huge problems)

groblad 1.3 (2007-10-02):

  - 'gavia_report --svalan' for another tabular output.

groblad 1.2 (2007-09-28):

  - 'gavia_report --sundh' for tabular output.

  - Remove the undocumented dependency on the 'geese' project (for
    gavia_report).

groblad 1.1 (2005-01-18):

  - groblad: temporary files have names ending in '.txt', so
    that emacs works better.
  - groblad_report: output formatting fixes.

groblad 1.0 (2005-01-06):

  - First real release.
