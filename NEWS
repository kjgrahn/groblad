groblad 1.6 (2009-08-16):
 - accept 'Status' as an additional excursion field, for e.g.
   'I have reported this' or whatever
 - groblad_report: changes to simplify import to Svalan (--svalan):
   - when the RT90 coordinate claims 1m resolution, say 5m instead
   - do not sort the list in taxonomical order, keep places together

groblad 1.5 (2008-10-13):
 - groblad_report --sundh/svalan: fill in the RT90 coordinate
   accuracy. Groblad uses the standard RT90 notation for accuracy --
   dropping digits to the right. This now gets translated; 64445 13717
   ends up as 6444500 1371700 100. (Or should that be 6444550 1371750
   100? Never mind.)

groblad 1.4 (2007-12-02):
 - groblad_report: improved syntax checking (earlier versions were
   quite sloppy and silently accepted many huge problems)

groblad 1.3 (2007-10-02):
  - 'gavia_report --svalan' for another tabular output.

groblad 1.2 (2007-09-28):
  - 'gavia_report --sundh' for tabular output.

  - Remove the undocumented dependency on the 'geese' project (for
    gavia_report).

groblad 1.1 (2005-01-18):
  - groblad: temporary files have names ending in '.txt', so
    that emacs works better.
  - groblad_report: output formatting fixes.

groblad 1.0 (2005-01-06):
  - First real release.
